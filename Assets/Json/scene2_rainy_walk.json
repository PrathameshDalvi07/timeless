    "I love the smell of rain — it’s like the world hits reset.",
    "I used to dance in the rain when I was little. My mom would yell, but secretly she’d record me on her phone.",
    "You know what’s funny? I still hum the same song every time it rains — ‘Raindrops Keep Fallin’ On My Head.’ Don’t act like you don’t know it!",
    "I brought my favorite blue umbrella today — though it’s technically more of a kind of purple now because I spilled grape juice on it last week.",
    "I always imagine this scene in a movie — two people sharing one umbrella, one of them pretending not to be cold but totally shivering.",
    "Don’t look at me like that, I’m fine!",
    "Oh, and I made hot chocolate before coming here, but of course I forgot to bring it. I even added those tiny marshmallows!",
    "You know, people say rain makes some people sad, but it makes me… dramatic. The good kind of dramatic."
