  - That night was quiet and warm, just the two of us on the beige couch.
  - "You brought a blanket \u2014 the soft cream one you love so much."
  - I picked the movie, of course. You always let me choose.
  - "It was a romance film \u2014 the one that always makes me cry at the end."
  - You teased me when I wiped a tear and said, 'Here we go again.'
  - I made popcorn, maybe a little burnt, but you said it was perfect anyway.
  - "You laughed before the jokes even landed \u2014 I loved that about you."
  - The only light came from the screen; everything else felt far away.
  - I wore my cozy gray sweater; you said I looked comfortable enough to sleep.
  - "We drank warm tea that night \u2014 no coffee, no soda, just tea."
  - "You told me you love romance movies even though you pretend you don\u2019t."
  - I said sad endings feel more real than happy ones.
  - "The clock ticked slowly \u2014 it felt like time stopped for us."
  - After the movie, you turned to me and said, 'That was perfect.'
  - "I smiled and said, 'Every movie\u2019s perfect when I\u2019m with you.'"
  - "Then I whispered, 'Don\u2019t forget this night.'"
  - The soft piano from the end credits filled the room.
  - "You stretched your arms and said you\u2019d make better popcorn next time."
  - "We sat in silence for a while, but it wasn\u2019t awkward \u2014 it was peaceful."
  - Even now, I can still hear the sound of the rain outside that night.
