  - "The rain started softly that evening \u2014 cold but peaceful."
  - You handed me your jacket, even though you were shivering yourself.
  - We shared that tiny black umbrella and kept walking close together.
  - The air smelled like wet earth and freshly baked bread from the nearby bakery.
  - I hummed that song from my favorite band while the raindrops fell.
  - The sky was dark gray, with just a hint of orange light at the edge.
  - We passed by the little bakery, and I said the smell was perfect for the rain.

  - We stopped at the bridge for a moment, watching the street lights reflect on
    water.

  - "When the rain stopped, I whispered, \u2018It\u2019s beautiful now.\u2019"
  - The air smelled clean, and everything was quiet except for our footsteps.
  - "I told you I\u2019d never forget that walk \u2014 the sound of rain, your jacket,
    everything."
  - The soft piano from the nearby shop played faintly in the background.
  - I looked at you, drenched and happy, and said this moment feels timeless.
  - "The world felt slow, like even time didn\u2019t want to move on."
  - "I said, \u2018Don\u2019t forget this walk,\u2019 and you nodded."
  - We walked home quietly, carrying the sound of the rain in our hearts.
