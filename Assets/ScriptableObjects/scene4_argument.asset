  - "It started with something small, didn\u2019t it?"
  - "You forgot something important to me \u2014 a memory, not a thing."
  - "I said you weren\u2019t listening\u2026 and maybe you weren\u2019t."
  - The cup on the table fell and shattered between us.
  - "That old coffee cup from our first caf\xE9 date, remember?"
  - I watched it roll off the wooden table, taking our words with it.
  - The white light in the room felt colder than ever.
  - "I didn\u2019t shout. My voice was calm but cold."
  - "You said nothing\u2026 silence hurts more than anger sometimes."
  - "I dropped the spoon too \u2014 it clinked softly against the floor."
  - Our trust cracked that night, not just the cup.
  - The coffee smell still lingered, mixed with the sound of breaking glass.
  - I looked down at the cup, not at you.
  - "I whispered \u2018why\u2019 under my breath, but you didn\u2019t hear it."
  - "I almost said sorry\u2026 but the words froze."
  - "You stood still. Didn\u2019t move. Didn\u2019t say a word."
  - Even the rain outside went quiet after that sound.
  - The last sound before silence was the cup breaking.
  - "Maybe the real problem wasn\u2019t words\u2026 maybe it was silence."
  - Do you still remember how it felt, when everything broke?
